<pre class="text">
For the above graph, which displays the number of car accidents by day of the week 
in Evanston from October 2016 to December 2021, I first found my data while browsing 
through the Evanston Data Portal, which contained a page on Evanston Traffic Crashes.

After downloading the data as a CSV, I then uploaded it into a Google Sheet. With the 
data, I wanted to explore whether or not more traffic crashes happened on particular 
days of the week. To do this, I inserted a pivot table, assigning days of the week to 
the rows and the count of the number of traffic accidents happening on those days to the 
corresponding values.

Using this table, I then uploaded it into Flourish, which turned it into a bar graph, 
showing the number of traffic accidents for different days of the week. 

According to the graph, the most traffic accidents happen on Fridays, with Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays following close behind. What is to note, however, is the large disparity 
between those days and Saturdays and Sundays, which saw numbers much less in comparison, 
with 1300 and 950 respectively. 

These findings could have numerous implications, including the fact that people usually 
are not driving as much during the weekend due to not having work. One reason to explain 
why the most amount of traffic accidents occur on Fridays could be due to drunk driving 
after people go out for the evening after work.

<pre class="text">
For the above graph, which displays the share of arrests by race in Evanston from September 
2018 to December 2021, I again found my data while browsing through the Evanston Data Portal, 
which contained a page on Arrests in Evanston. 

After downloading the data as a CSV, I then uploaded it into a Google Sheet. With the data, 
I wanted to show whether a particular race made up a disproportionate majority of arrests, 
which I did by using a pivot table and a formula. To make the pivot table, I assigned the 
races to the rows and the count of arrests by race to values. To then find the percentage 
shares, I used a simple division formula to divide arrests by race by the total number of 
arrests.

Using this data, I then uploaded it into Flourish, which turned it into a pie chart, showing 
the percentage shares of arrests by different races out of 4,756 total arrests in the city.

According to the graph, Black people arrested accounted for 61% of all arrests made in Evanston 
within the particular timeframe. White people arrested accounted for 36%, while Asian people 
arrested accounted for 2%. 

Comparing this to 2020 Census data, even though only 16% of the city’s population identifies as 
Black, they make up a disproportionate amount of arrests. Expanding on this, despite the fact 
that around 59% of the city’s population identify as white and 10% percent identify as Asian, 
they only make up 36% and 2% percent of arrests respectively.

<pre class="text">
For the above map, which shows the number of alternative fuel locations (i.e. EV charging stations) 
per zip code in Chicago, I first had to define the region geometry, which I was able to do by downloading 
a GeoJSON file from the Chicago Data Portal and then uploading it into the regions geometry section of my 
Flourish map. After doing this, I then assigned the geometry to column A, which contained the shapes of 
the different zip codes, and IDs to match to column E, which contained the zip codes themselves.

After establishing the geometry, I then downloaded a CSV of a data set containing the locations of alternative 
fuel locations across Chicago. I then inserted a pivot table, assigning the zip codes to the rows and the 
count of fuel locations per zip code to the corresponding values. After this, I then uploaded the pivot 
table into my Flourish map, which shaded the regions to show where there is a larger concentration of 
alternative fuel locations in the city.
  
With this map, I wanted to see whether there would be a disparity between the number of alternative fuel 
locations between the North and South Sides of Chicago. Based on this, though the difference isn’t huge, 
we can still see the lack of alternative fuel locations within the South parts of the city, with many 
zip codes only containing one location in comparison to the around 7 or 8 in many North Side zip codes.
