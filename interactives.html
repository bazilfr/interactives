<pre class="text">
For the above graph, which displays the number of car accidents by day of the week 
in Evanston from October 2016 to December 2021, I first found my data while browsing 
through the Evanston Data Portal, which contained a page on Evanston Traffic Crashes.

After downloading the data as a CSV, I then uploaded it into a Google Sheet. With the 
data, I wanted to explore whether or not more traffic crashes happened on particular 
days of the week. To do this, I inserted a pivot table, assigning days of the week to 
the rows and the count of the number of traffic accidents happening on those days to the 
corresponding values.

Using this table, I then uploaded it into Flourish, which turned it into a bar graph, 
showing the number of traffic accidents for different days of the week. 

According to the graph, the most traffic accidents happen on Fridays, with Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays following close behind. What is to note, however, is the large disparity 
between those days and Saturdays and Sundays, which saw numbers much less in comparison, 
with 1300 and 950 respectively. 

These findings could have numerous implications, including the fact that people usually 
are not driving as much during the weekend due to not having work. One reason to explain 
why the most amount of traffic accidents occur on Fridays could be due to drunk driving 
after people go out for the evening after work.
