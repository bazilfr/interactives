  <pre>[music: “Padam Padam” by Kylie Minogue]
        
    Bazil Frueh: Hey Yumi.....

    Yumi Tallud: Yes Bazil?
    
    BF: I have something really important to tell you… I’m gay.

    YT: Oh, wow, I would have never guessed. 

    BF: Really?

    YT: Nah man, I’m messing with you.

    BF: But how could you tell?

    YT: Well just look at you… you have a big chunky patterned sweater on…

    BF: Well sure I guess… but what really queer trend hasn’t been adopted by 
    the masses these days like…

    YT: Carabiners…

    BF: Croptops…

    YT: Doc Martens…

    BF: Poppers!

    YT: With queer fashion trends entering mainstream spaces more and more everyday, 
    gaydar has gone completely out of whack. 

    BF: For years, queer and straight people alike have used the term to describe 
    their ability to recognize someone's sexual orientation due to a number of, 
    often, stereotypical and generalized identifiers. These can come in many forms: 
    the fashions one wears, how someone walks, how someone talks, etc. etc. 

    YT: For queer people, gaydar can be a way for people to quickly identify 
    who they may relate to and find community with. For straight people, 
    it can be a way to label and “other” people based merely on surface-level 
    judgments. 
    
    BF: But, really, what does queerness… or even gayness… really 
    look like anyway? As subcultures become more easily shared across 
    social media, many inherently “queer” trends have lost their 
    status as identifiers. 
    
    YT: To hear more about this, we talked to Northwestern students 
    to hear their thoughts on all things gaydar… seeing whether it 
    even existed, and if it did, does it still? 
    
    BF: We also wanted to know their thoughts on queerness entering the zeitgeist. 
    
    YT: Firstly, here’s Medill sophomore Luis Castañeda.
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: I think gaydar is to me kind of like a survival instinct. 
    Because as a queer person, you need to find another queer person—and 
    I'm not saying you need a relationship to really survive—but I'm saying 
    I like to think of things in kind of the scientific way.
    
    BF: To Castañeda, using gaydar can be an important way to 
    identify other members of the queer community. In recent 
    times though, this has become a bit harder to do. 
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: You run into an issue where that ability to be able to find 
    your group becomes a little harder, because you might think that someone is gay 
    or queer, because they're acting a certain way, because they're wearing a 
    certain piece of art. Because they enjoy certain music, right? And you're 
    completely gooped when you find out that they're like, they’re straight. 
    And you're like, wait, what?
    
    CLARA WOOD: And I saw this woman. I was like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, 
    love of my life, and she's definitely gay. Like, yes, like, I know this. 
    I know this. Wrong. Kisses a man, like 5 minutes later, clearly her boyfriend. 
    I was like, okay… And then my other like gay friend was like, wow, our culture 
    is not their costume, and like, obviously that’s like,  a little heinous to say, 
    but I was like, lowkey…
    
    YT: That was Weinberg freshman Clara Wood. She’s crashed and 
    burned a few times when it comes to accidentally hitting on straight women.
     But, in terms of big-picture, she doesn’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing.
    
    CW: The amount of times I've been off at this school… I have 
    no trust in my ability. I think like, while it's annoying at times, 
    I also think it's, like, kind of cool that like, it's a lot more mixed 
    together and it can also be like, hopefully less alienating for queer 
    people. But I also think, even though I've lost my gaydar, it's also kind 
    of like, well now it’s just like, something that you can learn about someone 
    rather than, like, something that separates you from the crowd. It's just 
    like a part of their identity, just like everyone has other parts of 
    their identity. It feels a lot more stigma– a lot less, a lot less stigmatized. 
    
  [music: “Good Luck Babe” by Chappell Roan]

    BF: Though specific queer identifiers play a crucial role in how 
    someone is labeled, Medill and Weinberg sophomore Sydney Johnson 
    expressed concerns over whether these can become too constrictive. 
    
    SYDNEY JOHNSON: I just don't want it to become like a thing where 
    people feel like they can only wear something if they are gay, or 
    if they aren't, or if maybe there's somebody who's questioning and 
    they're trying to, like experiment with fashion. And then they don't 
    feel comfortable because people are telling them they can't wear it.
    
    YT: In some cases, these identifiers alienate queer people who don’t 
    fit into the stereotypical boxes.
    
    DANIEL CALDERON: My sophomore year, I was out at Bob's and one of my friends 
    that will remain nameless… but they came to me and they went like, y’know, 
    I just don't think you're gay. And I went, well, that's like– what does 
    that mean? He's like, I just don't believe it. I just don't– I don't see it. 
    Like, I don't buy it, whatever. And I was like, OK, that's– well, I am, like, 
    I don't know what else to do then.
    
    YT: That was Communication senior Daniel Calderon. He’s been grappling with 
    not presenting as gay right off the bat, especially as a man who is 
    very proud to be queer.
    
    DC: It has come up a lot recently, like I went to Cancun for spring break 
    and I was talking to the, shout out to the John Hopkins soccer team, but 
    they were talking to us, and I was with my friend Matheus and my friend Adam, 
    and all three of us were talking to this one guy. And we were like joking 
    around being like, oh, like guess our major, like the three of us, like 
    we're all in the same major. Come on, come on, like guess it like and they 
    couldn't guess it. And we kept being like three of us. We like, what do we 
    look like? Like come on like it's like, stereotypical, like it's okay to 
    go there. And then he comes up to me like whispers at me. He's like, well, 
    I know those two are gay but I don't know about you. And I went what? 
    And then I went, and I went on like a rampage. I went to every guy on this 
    John Hopkins team and I was like, what can I do to be gayer?
    
    YT: It’s easy to think that just because someone else is queer, it means you’ll 
    get along with them, whether it be for cultural reasons, or simply because 
    you have something in common. However, that’s not always the case. Here’s what 
    Communication senior Maggie McKenna had to say. 
    
    MAGGIE MCKENNA: I met this Northwestern lesbian while I was studying 
    abroad because she was in a class with my roommate and I was like, 
    yes, another lesbian and then she was just the worst. And she still 
    goes here, all my love to her. But I think that that experience 
    taught me that like, not all queer people are awesome and like, 
    just because there is another lesbian doesn't mean I want to be 
    friends with them.
    
    YT: Northwestern’s queer community certainly isn’t perfect, and McKenna further 
    expanded on her thoughts about the community.
    
    MM: I think that a lot of people really like to talk about being gay. 
    And sometimes I'm like, why are you talking about this so much? 
    Like, we should all talk about our identities, but sometimes I feel 
    like people talk about it for social capital. Yeah, I think that 
    there are a lot of– a lot– there are some straight people who I have 
    met at this university who I'm like, I think sometimes you’re overstepping 
    what is okay to do and say as a straight person because you're surrounded 
    by a lot of queer people. There aren't many straight people in theater, 
    but I think a lot of them do kind of also use queerness as social capital 
    despite not being queer.
    
    BF: While talking about gaydar, our conversation then drifted to a broader talk 
    on how we use the term queer, especially when identifying others. To Johnson, 
    the term extends far beyond how most people define it. 
    
    SYDNEY JOHNSON: I feel like queerness is something that you can 
    explore outside of simply your sexual orientation. And so it'd be 
    something that you feel invited to explore, in like, every facet 
    of your life, pushing those limits. I want people to know the history 
    of queer culture and fashion, and I also want people to not 
    think that it's something that's just for gay people.
    
    BF: Castañeda echoed a similar point, expressing that he’s okay 
    with gaydar's gray area status if it means more people are finding 
    value in queerness. 
    
    LC: So maybe it is a good thing that the gaydar is broken. You know, 
    like, maybe people should be more liberated to be more queer, do 
    queer actions. Because at the end of the day, it dissolves that kind of word 
    in itself. If everyone's queer, no one's queer.
    
    BF: For WNUR News, I’m Bazil Frueh…
    
    YT: And I’m Yumi Tallud.

  <pre>[music: “Pump It Up” by Endor]

    Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself? I sure have. 
    But, as “The Substance” teaches us—be careful what you wish for. 

    In the Coralie Fargeat written and directed film, Demi Moore plays 
    an aging celebrity who, after losing her longtime television gig, 
    turns to a black market drug that creates a much younger version of 
    herself, played by Margaret Qualley. Things go awry, however, after 
    Moore’s counterpart begins to fly too close to the sun, ignoring the 
    stipulations that come with the mysterious substance.
    
    Despite being a blood-curdling masterpiece of body horror, 
    “The Substance” is an all-around mother show. Moore and Qualley 
    both offer first-rate performances, demonstrating complete control 
    over their respective characters. Not only are the performances great, 
    but the script as well, with the film winning Best Screenplay 
    at this past year’s Cannes Film Festival. 
    
    To dive deeper into the film, I sat down with my friend Luis Castañeda 
    after watching it to better collect our thoughts, our interpretations, 
    and figure out what we ended up taking away from “The Substance.” 
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: I went into “The Substance” knowing that a lot of the 
    queer people online, like on Twitter, Instagram, were obsessed with it. 
    And it had good reviews also, and I think it was nominated for an award, 
    or it won an award. And I was like, okay, the “Joker” is flopping, 
    this other “Megalopolis” or whatever, I can't even remember what it's called 
    because that was also flopping.
    
    Because of the lack of good movie options, Castañeda and I eventually settled 
    on the horror flick. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: We need to see a good movie. And I went into it excited, and surely 
    enough, my hopes were not let down. It was a fantastic movie, it was funny, 
    surprisingly, but also kind of scary in the right type of sense. And I loved it.
    
    Though the film did contain many comedic elements, I was curious about 
    what Castañeda thought about its status as a horror movie. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: I find it horrifying because I deal with my own fears 
    of growing old, of my body not being perceived in the same way as 
    I grow older, and fears that my career is based on how I look, so in 
    that way I saw the movie and I saw myself, and to me that's the horror 
    that speaks out more than any jumpscare could ever.
    
    Much of the film focuses on how unrealistic beauty standards reverberate 
    throughout the entertainment industry. Thinking about what the movie had 
    to say, I asked Castañeda what he took away from the story.
    
    CASTAÑEDA: I think especially for women in these industries, there's kind 
    of this standard of the male perspective that they need to always abide by 
    because most of the people in charge right of almost any industry is going 
    to be a man, and usually the products for the entertainment industry are 
    beautiful women, and when they're no longer perceived as beautiful, there's 
    no consumeristic value in it. 
   
    When I asked Castañeda whether he would ever take the substance, his answer 
    was one rooted in anxiety. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: That's a really scary question because I feel like in 50 years we 
    might be able to actually take the substance. I want to be a broadcast 
    journalist, and that means I've had a conversation with a professor one time 
    where I asked how important, you know, beauty is in getting a job in broadcast 
    and he full on told me like yeah, it's true, I think people do care about 
    how people look, especially if they're on TV. 
    
    If a mother takes the substance, and no one is around to see it, does she 
    still slay? In “The Substance,” Fargeat offers a cautionary tale, combatting 
    unrealistic beauty standards in the most gut-wrenching, but equally effective, 
    way possible. Sure, you can try as hard as you want to slow the inevitable 
    forces of aging, but always remember: you are one. 
    
    For WNUR News, I’m Bazil Frueh.
