  <pre>[music: “Padam Padam” by Kylie Minogue]
        
    Bazil Frueh: Hey Yumi.....

    Yumi Tallud: Yes Bazil?
    
    BF: I have something really important to tell you… I’m gay.

    YT: Oh, wow, I would have never guessed. 

    BF: Really?

    YT: Nah man, I’m messing with you.

    BF: But how could you tell?

    YT: Well just look at you… you have a big chunky patterned sweater on…

    BF: Well sure I guess… but what really queer trend hasn’t been adopted by 
    the masses these days like…

    YT: Carabiners…

    BF: Croptops…

    YT: Doc Martens…

    BF: Poppers!

    YT: With queer fashion trends entering mainstream spaces more and more everyday, 
    gaydar has gone completely out of whack. 

    BF: For years, queer and straight people alike have used the term to describe 
    their ability to recognize someone's sexual orientation due to a number of, 
    often, stereotypical and generalized identifiers. These can come in many forms: 
    the fashions one wears, how someone walks, how someone talks, etc. etc. 

    YT: For queer people, gaydar can be a way for people to quickly identify 
    who they may relate to and find community with. For straight people, 
    it can be a way to label and “other” people based merely on surface-level 
    judgments. 
    
    BF: But, really, what does queerness… or even gayness… really 
    look like anyway? As subcultures become more easily shared across 
    social media, many inherently “queer” trends have lost their 
    status as identifiers. 
    
    YT: To hear more about this, we talked to Northwestern students 
    to hear their thoughts on all things gaydar… seeing whether it 
    even existed, and if it did, does it still? 
    
    BF: We also wanted to know their thoughts on queerness entering the zeitgeist. 
    
    YT: Firstly, here’s Medill sophomore Luis Castañeda.
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: I think gaydar is to me kind of like a survival instinct. 
    Because as a queer person, you need to find another queer person—and 
    I'm not saying you need a relationship to really survive—but I'm saying 
    I like to think of things in kind of the scientific way.
    
    BF: To Castañeda, using gaydar can be an important way to 
    identify other members of the queer community. In recent 
    times though, this has become a bit harder to do. 
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: You run into an issue where that ability to be able to find 
    your group becomes a little harder, because you might think that someone is gay 
    or queer, because they're acting a certain way, because they're wearing a 
    certain piece of art. Because they enjoy certain music, right? And you're 
    completely gooped when you find out that they're like, they’re straight. 
    And you're like, wait, what?
    
    CLARA WOOD: And I saw this woman. I was like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, 
    love of my life, and she's definitely gay. Like, yes, like, I know this. 
    I know this. Wrong. Kisses a man, like 5 minutes later, clearly her boyfriend. 
    I was like, okay… And then my other like gay friend was like, wow, our culture 
    is not their costume, and like, obviously that’s like,  a little heinous to say, 
    but I was like, lowkey…
    
    YT: That was Weinberg freshman Clara Wood. She’s crashed and 
    burned a few times when it comes to accidentally hitting on straight women.
     But, in terms of big-picture, she doesn’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing.
    
    CW: The amount of times I've been off at this school… I have 
    no trust in my ability. I think like, while it's annoying at times, 
    I also think it's, like, kind of cool that like, it's a lot more mixed 
    together and it can also be like, hopefully less alienating for queer 
    people. But I also think, even though I've lost my gaydar, it's also kind 
    of like, well now it’s just like, something that you can learn about someone 
    rather than, like, something that separates you from the crowd. It's just 
    like a part of their identity, just like everyone has other parts of 
    their identity. It feels a lot more stigma– a lot less, a lot less stigmatized. 
    
  [music: “Good Luck Babe” by Chappell Roan]

    BF: Though specific queer identifiers play a crucial role in how 
    someone is labeled, Medill and Weinberg sophomore Sydney Johnson 
    expressed concerns over whether these can become too constrictive. 
    
    SYDNEY JOHNSON: I just don't want it to become like a thing where 
    people feel like they can only wear something if they are gay, or 
    if they aren't, or if maybe there's somebody who's questioning and 
    they're trying to, like experiment with fashion. And then they don't 
    feel comfortable because people are telling them they can't wear it.
    
    YT: In some cases, these identifiers alienate queer people who don’t 
    fit into the stereotypical boxes.
    
    DANIEL CALDERON: My sophomore year, I was out at Bob's and one of my friends 
    that will remain nameless… but they came to me and they went like, y’know, 
    I just don't think you're gay. And I went, well, that's like– what does 
    that mean? He's like, I just don't believe it. I just don't– I don't see it. 
    Like, I don't buy it, whatever. And I was like, OK, that's– well, I am, like, 
    I don't know what else to do then.
    
    YT: That was Communication senior Daniel Calderon. He’s been grappling with 
    not presenting as gay right off the bat, especially as a man who is 
    very proud to be queer.
    
    DC: It has come up a lot recently, like I went to Cancun for spring break 
    and I was talking to the, shout out to the John Hopkins soccer team, but 
    they were talking to us, and I was with my friend Matheus and my friend Adam, 
    and all three of us were talking to this one guy. And we were like joking 
    around being like, oh, like guess our major, like the three of us, like 
    we're all in the same major. Come on, come on, like guess it like and they 
    couldn't guess it. And we kept being like three of us. We like, what do we 
    look like? Like come on like it's like, stereotypical, like it's okay to 
    go there. And then he comes up to me like whispers at me. He's like, well, 
    I know those two are gay but I don't know about you. And I went what? 
    And then I went, and I went on like a rampage. I went to every guy on this 
    John Hopkins team and I was like, what can I do to be gayer?
    
    YT: It’s easy to think that just because someone else is queer, it means you’ll 
    get along with them, whether it be for cultural reasons, or simply because 
    you have something in common. However, that’s not always the case. Here’s what 
    Communication senior Maggie McKenna had to say. 
    
    MAGGIE MCKENNA: I met this Northwestern lesbian while I was studying 
    abroad because she was in a class with my roommate and I was like, 
    yes, another lesbian and then she was just the worst. And she still 
    goes here, all my love to her. But I think that that experience 
    taught me that like, not all queer people are awesome and like, 
    just because there is another lesbian doesn't mean I want to be 
    friends with them.
    
    YT: Northwestern’s queer community certainly isn’t perfect, and McKenna further 
    expanded on her thoughts about the community.
    
    MM: I think that a lot of people really like to talk about being gay. 
    And sometimes I'm like, why are you talking about this so much? 
    Like, we should all talk about our identities, but sometimes I feel 
    like people talk about it for social capital. Yeah, I think that 
    there are a lot of– a lot– there are some straight people who I have 
    met at this university who I'm like, I think sometimes you’re overstepping 
    what is okay to do and say as a straight person because you're surrounded 
    by a lot of queer people. There aren't many straight people in theater, 
    but I think a lot of them do kind of also use queerness as social capital 
    despite not being queer.
    
    BF: While talking about gaydar, our conversation then drifted to a broader talk 
    on how we use the term queer, especially when identifying others. To Johnson, 
    the term extends far beyond how most people define it. 
    
    SYDNEY JOHNSON: I feel like queerness is something that you can 
    explore outside of simply your sexual orientation. And so it'd be 
    something that you feel invited to explore, in like, every facet 
    of your life, pushing those limits. I want people to know the history 
    of queer culture and fashion, and I also want people to not 
    think that it's something that's just for gay people.
    
    BF: Castañeda echoed a similar point, expressing that he’s okay 
    with gaydar's gray area status if it means more people are finding 
    value in queerness. 
    
    LC: So maybe it is a good thing that the gaydar is broken. You know, 
    like, maybe people should be more liberated to be more queer, do 
    queer actions. Because at the end of the day, it dissolves that kind of word 
    in itself. If everyone's queer, no one's queer.
    
    BF: For WNUR News, I’m Bazil Frueh…

  <pre>[music: “Pump It Up” by Endor]

    Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself? I sure have. 
    But, as “The Substance” teaches us—be careful what you wish for. 

    In the Coralie Fargeat written and directed film, Demi Moore plays 
    an aging celebrity who, after losing her longtime television gig, 
    turns to a black market drug that creates a much younger version of 
    herself, played by Margaret Qualley. Things go awry, however, after 
    Moore’s counterpart begins to fly too close to the sun, ignoring the 
    stipulations that come with the mysterious substance.
    
    Despite being a blood-curdling masterpiece of body horror, 
    “The Substance” is an all-around mother show. Moore and Qualley 
    both offer first-rate performances, demonstrating complete control 
    over their respective characters. Not only are the performances great, 
    but the script as well, with the film winning Best Screenplay 
    at this past year’s Cannes Film Festival. 
    
    To dive deeper into the film, I sat down with my friend Luis Castañeda 
    after watching it to better collect our thoughts, our interpretations, 
    and figure out what we ended up taking away from “The Substance.” 
    
    LUIS CASTAÑEDA: I went into “The Substance” knowing that a lot of the 
    queer people online, like on Twitter, Instagram, were obsessed with it. 
    And it had good reviews also, and I think it was nominated for an award, 
    or it won an award. And I was like, okay, the “Joker” is flopping, 
    this other “Megalopolis” or whatever, I can't even remember what it's called 
    because that was also flopping.
    
    Because of the lack of good movie options, Castañeda and I eventually settled 
    on the horror flick. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: We need to see a good movie. And I went into it excited, and surely 
    enough, my hopes were not let down. It was a fantastic movie, it was funny, 
    surprisingly, but also kind of scary in the right type of sense. And I loved it.
    
    Though the film did contain many comedic elements, I was curious about 
    what Castañeda thought about its status as a horror movie. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: I find it horrifying because I deal with my own fears 
    of growing old, of my body not being perceived in the same way as 
    I grow older, and fears that my career is based on how I look, so in 
    that way I saw the movie and I saw myself, and to me that's the horror 
    that speaks out more than any jumpscare could ever.
    
    Much of the film focuses on how unrealistic beauty standards reverberate 
    throughout the entertainment industry. Thinking about what the movie had 
    to say, I asked Castañeda what he took away from the story.
    
    CASTAÑEDA: I think especially for women in these industries, there's kind 
    of this standard of the male perspective that they need to always abide by 
    because most of the people in charge right of almost any industry is going 
    to be a man, and usually the products for the entertainment industry are 
    beautiful women, and when they're no longer perceived as beautiful, there's 
    no consumeristic value in it. 
   
    When I asked Castañeda whether he would ever take the substance, his answer 
    was one rooted in anxiety. 
    
    CASTAÑEDA: That's a really scary question because I feel like in 50 years we 
    might be able to actually take the substance. I want to be a broadcast 
    journalist, and that means I've had a conversation with a professor one time 
    where I asked how important, you know, beauty is in getting a job in broadcast 
    and he full on told me like yeah, it's true, I think people do care about 
    how people look, especially if they're on TV. 
    
    If a mother takes the substance, and no one is around to see it, does she 
    still slay? In “The Substance,” Fargeat offers a cautionary tale, combatting 
    unrealistic beauty standards in the most gut-wrenching, but equally effective, 
    way possible. Sure, you can try as hard as you want to slow the inevitable 
    forces of aging, but always remember: you are one. 
    
    For WNUR News, I’m Bazil Frueh.

  <pre>[dancemoms clips on YouTube, Abby Lee Miller on tape] 
    JoJo! Have you learned nothing?

[music: “Borough” by Blue Dot Sessions]
    
    JoJo Siwa has, in fact, learned nothing. The Dance Moms alum, once known for 
    her slick-back ponytail and larger-than-life hair bows, has entered her Bangerz 
    era. Or, at least, she’s trying to—to the dismay of the chronically online and 
    Generation Z alike. 
    
[music fades]
    
    Siwa originally gained notoriety after placing in the top-5 on the second 
    season of Abby Lee Miller’s Ultimate Dance Competition, then joining the 
    famed dance instructor’s company soon thereafter. 
    
    After her two season tenure on the infamous reality show, Siwa began her 
    music career with the release of the 2016 single “Boomerang,” 
    establishing her association with the PC, kid-friendly, and kitschy 
    image she’s been unable to shake. 
    
    Leading up to 2024, it seemed Siwa’s Nickelodeon-safe appeal was here 
    to stay. That is until we got “Karma”—Siwa’s fatally capitalistic, and, 
    shocker!, mild profanity-laced attempt to prove to the world that:
    
[music: “Karma” by JoJo Siwa] I was a bad girl, I did some bad things.
    
    Of course, the Internet had its thoughts, for the most part universally 
    panning the dancer-turned-wannabe-popstar for what was deemed as “faux-edgy” 
    and “performed with all the conviction of the elementary-age students who 
    used to be her fans” by Jason P. Frank of Vulture. 
    
    Tired of sifting through all the discourse, I was curious about what my 
    Northwestern peers had to say. To do so, I assembled a packed roundtable 
    of JoJo fans, JoJo fan-adjacents, and everyone in between to get the scoop. 
    Here’s what they had to say:
    
    AVA HOELSCHER: So JoJo Siwa is from Iowa and I’m from Iowa, so we have a 
    really deep emotional connection that goes way back. Actually, the very 
    first article that I ever published was about JoJo Siwa because her aunt 
    lives in my hometown. So we’re basically like sisters.

    That’s Medill and Weinberg sophomore Ava Hoelscher. We began our 
    conversation by discussing initial impressions of the “Karma” singer, 
    taking it all the way back to her Dance Mom days. 
    
    VIRGINIA HUNT: I watched her on there when she was kind of constantly 
    bullied by Abby, and she was kind of an underdog. And so I feel like in 
    some ways, you kind of rooted for her a little, just because she was real. 

    That’s Medill and Weinberg sophomore Virginia Hunt. To her, seeing Siwa 
    initially start on the show at such a young age fostered a sense of sympathy. 
    For Weinberg sophomore Ella Marks, however, her associations with the singer 
    tended to align with the greater Internet’s. 

    ELLA MARKS: The first things that I think of when I think of JoJo Siwa are 
    the bows and the receding hairline. I feel like her receding hairline was such 
    a big topic of conversation, and I know it sounds funny but genuinely those 
    are my first memories.

    After talking impressions, I was curious to hear the group’s thoughts on what 
    everyone can’t seem to stop talking about: “Karma.” Opinions, expectedly, 
    were mixed. 

    AINSLIE WILSON: Initial reaction: wow. I couldn’t stop watching the music 
    video. I think it’s brilliant. It does its job if its job is capturing 
    attention. And I do think it’s catchy.

    That’s School of Communication sophomore Ainslie Wilson. Though others in 
    the group were more iffy about the single, Wilson spoke high praise for Siwa 
    and her edgier musical rebrand. Others, including Medill and Weinberg sophomore 
    Lexi Goldstein,  commented on the song’s music video and its inclusivity. 

    LEXI GOLDSTEIN: I feel like that is one of the better things that came from 
    the music video and the song, mainly the music video, and the representation 
    was great for the queer community. But at the same time, I think—I’m sorry 
    for saying this—it’s kind of a forgettable song.

    Siwa came out as queer in 2021 and has since become a staunch advocate against
     bullying and discrimination against people based on sexual orientation. 
     Despite supporting her work for the LGBTQ+ community, Goldstein was 
     critical over Siwa’s recent memeable comments on how she “wanted to start a 
     new genre … called ‘gay pop’” through the release of “Karma.”
    
     GOLDSTEIN: There’s so many queer icons that came before her and have produced 
     art forms that are music or otherwise that are just a lot more mature.

     Siwa also caught flack after listeners found out that “Karma” wasn’t completely 
     a JoJo original. Back in 2012, singer Brit Smith had attempted to launch her 
     career with the song, which, after Siwa’s release, resurfaced on TikTok when 
     users noted the exact same lyrics in both versions. 

     After Smith’s recording began charting, many on the Internet were quick to 
     accuse Siwa of “stealing,” though Smith has since come to Siwa’s defense, 
     stating that she had “done nothing wrong.”

     Despite the backlash, though, many in the group were quick to defend 
     Siwa’s savviness.

     HOELSCHER: People can say what they will but JoJo has been a businesswoman 
     since the beginning. She’s been selling JoJo bowbows, and now she’s marketing 
     the heck out of this song. And I appreciate her for that.

     Like Hoelscher, Goldstein echoed a similar appreciation for the way JoJo has 
     run her business.

     GOLDSTEIN: Her entire empire is built off of pretending like she’s not aware 
     of how other people perceive her, but playing into it. And I think, you know, 
     if it makes you millions of dollars, it’s kind of like, why not?

     As Siwa sings many times throughout “Boomerang,” she just “won’t let the haters 
     get their way,” something that Marks was quick to note. 

     MARKS: I feel like people hate on her so much, but at the end of the day, 
     she doesn’t outwardly care about the hate at least and also is profiting off 
     of it much more than most of her haters are.

     For Hunt, what really strikes her about the singer is what really lies 
     underneath all of this new found “bad girl” branding. 

     HUNT: I really do feel like part of the intrigue is I just want the 
     mask to come off because I feel like when she was younger, like sure 
     that might have been like her personality. But I think now that she’s 
     20 something I’m like there’s no way.

     So what will come of JoJo Siwa’s journey into the “dark side?” Will 
     the mask come off? Was it all just a publicity stunt? Only time will tell. 
     For now, though, we’ll keep convulsively dancing our hearts out to “Karma,” 
     no matter what the haters say.

  <pre>[music: “Sissy That Walk” by RuPaul]

    Buckle up and start your engines—the 16th season of RuPaul’s Drag Race
    is underway, bringing memorable challenges, breathtaking runways, and 
    gagworthy drama. 
    
    The season premiered on MTV on Jan. 5, introducing the world to a brand 
    new group of talented queens—all vying for the title of “America’s Next 
    Drag Superstar” and a grand prize of $200,000. 
    
    With six episodes already behind us, I talked to three Northwestern Drag 
    Race fans to hear their thoughts on the season so far:
    
    MISTY ROE: I’ve seen an embarrassing amount of Drag Race, honestly. I watched 
    seasons four through seven, like, three, four years ago. And then I didn’t 
    watch anything until last summer. And since last summer, I’ve watched 
    10…15 seasons.
    
    That’s Weinberg junior Misty Roe. They said the diversity of queens and their 
    styles has made season 16 a great watch.
    
    ROE: I’ve been enjoying it for sure. I like the kind of variety of queens 
    that there are, there’s like, the kind of more left field queens like Dawn, 
    and everything. And there’s some more, I don’t want to say typical, but more 
    like, like, right field, or I guess, more expected drag styles. I like the 
    personalities on the season as well. I like how ridiculous they all are.
    
    Medill senior Yiming Fu had similar praise. 
    
    YIMING FU: I think it’s a fun season. I feel like everyone is good, the 
    talent is high. And the talents are diverse too—there’s people who can dance, 
    who can sew, who are funny, who can act, who can sing, and you have that 
    whole spectrum and it feels pretty evenly distributed. 
    
    For Bienen sophomore Casey Weisman, he says the versatile group of queens 
    are promising a season full of entertaining moments. 
    
    CASEY WEISMAN: I think it’s shaping up to be really good. There’s a lot of 
    shade, there’s a lot of personality right off the bat. And so far, everyone’s 
    doing pretty good. There’s not really much flops.
    
    The season features 14 queens from cities all across the United States. 
    In terms of favorites, Weisman has a handful. 
    
    WEISMAN: Well, my favorite is definitely Sapphira Cristál. I think she’s the 
    mother of all queens. I really like Nymphia, I really like Morphine. I like 
    Xunami actually…oh, I love Mhi’ya Iman Le’Paige… “the queen of flips” and I 
    love Geneva “Vroom Vroom” Karr because she’s La Diva Más Latina. 
    
    Every episode, the queens compete in challenges with the hopes of accruing 
    enough wins to snatch the crown at the end of the season. Typical challenges 
    range from sketch comedy to fashion design to songwriting.   
    
    FU: I’ve liked the challenges a lot so far, because my favorite two challenges 
    usually are the talent show and the ball. So to have them back to back, I really 
    was like, oh, hey those are my favorite challenges.
    
    Each episode of Drag Race also features a runway segment where the queens get to 
    show off a look based on a specific theme. For Fu, he says he’s been impressed 
    by what he’s seen so far. 
    
    FU: The looks for the most part have been strong this season. And I think it 
    also does come back to the 16 seasons aspect and queens being very self aware 
    of what they need to bring to make it either in the competition or to make it 
    online. And, I feel like the budget is just higher, and people are really 
    committed to pushing it and having those big moments.
    
    Every season of Drag Race always comes with its fair share of drama and shade. 
    With season 16, particular attention has been drawn to Boston’s Plane Jane, who, 
    throughout the first couple of episodes, seemed to be at the center of it all. 
    For Roe, Plane’s antics have been a consistent source of entertainment. 
    
    ROE: I love it. I’m obsessed with Plane Jane. I am here for it. I want 
    her to win. I understand where the other people are coming from because 
    Plane is objectively being incredibly mean. However, I feel like they 
    need to stop taking her so seriously because they know she’s just there 
    to pick a fight.
    
    At the end of every episode, the two bottom queens who perform the worst 
    in that week’s challenge must then “lipsync for their life” to prevent 
    themselves from “sashaying away.” For Weisman, the first couple of 
    eliminations seemed justified. 
    
    WEISMAN: Lowkey… I’m fine with them all. The first one was Hershii. 
    Yeah, I think she kind of sent herself home. And then Mirage also kind 
    of set herself home even though I liked Mirage and I was sad to see her go. 
    
    In terms of who might be the top contenders for the win, 
    all three fans were in general agreement. 
    
    WEISMAN: I think it’s definitely between Sapphira and Nymphia.
    
    FU: I love Nymphia Wind. I don’t know if she’s gonna win. 
    I hope she does, but I would also be equally as happy if 
    Sapphira Cristál won. 
    
    ROE: I think it’s going to be Nymphia or Sapphira. 
    
    For those looking to get into Drag Race, Roe says that getting together 
    with friends can be a great way to break into it. They also recommend 
    exploring the world of drag outside of the show. 
    
    ROE: I think watching with people can be fun. I think that’s a big part 
    of it is discussing it being like I like this, I don’t like this. 
    I would also say branch out of drag race, find other queens, go to 
    local drag shows, support local drag. That’s really important.

  <pre>[nat sound: passing traffic at Weber Arch]

    It’s winter at Northwestern, meaning students are spending much of their time 
    bundled up in fuzzy winter jackets to escape the cold. Stuck yearning for 
    sunny days lounging on the Lakefill, the season is a time where many long 
    for warmth in the midst of gray, dreary days. 
    
    It’s hard not to daydream, thinking about what an ideal day would look 
    like if the weather was warmer and the sun was shining. 
    
    But what’s in a perfect day? I asked four Northwestern students to 
    describe theirs from morning to midnight. For Medill sophomore 
    Cate Bikales, hers would involve nature, close friends and family, 
    and her dogs:
    
[nat sound: waves crashing]
    
    CATE BIKALES: I would wake up around 10 a.m. in a small cottage house 
    on the coast of Oregon, which is where I’m from. Being on the coast 
    has always been my favorite thing, it just makes me so happy. 
    
    Bikales is vegan, meaning her ideal breakfast would consist of some 
    of her favorite homemade dishes.
    
    BIKALES: Me and my family would cook some breakfast, maybe some vegan 
    tofu scramble, some vegan pancakes, which don’t sound very good, but 
    to me, they’re delicious.
    
    After her meal, Bikales’s morning plans would continue with some time 
    spent outdoors. 
    
[nat sound: wind blowing and birds chirping]
    
    BIKALES: And then we would go outside and go on a hike a little, like 
    11 a.m. hike, the weather would be around 70 degrees. So not too hot, 
    not too cold. And it would be a summer day on the coast. So some cool 
    breeze, but also the sun is out. 
    
    Moving into the afternoon, Medill sophomore Kunjal Bastola’s ideal midday 
    activity would consist of an outing with her sister.  
    
    KUNJAL BASTOLA: I’d probably go to a bookstore, browse the books—my 
    perfect day would include me having the perfect amount of money. And so 
    I’d be able to buy whatever I wanted.
    
    Despite eating brunch earlier in the day, Bastola would still have 
    room for a nice lunch.
    
    BASTOLA: But you know what,  I would go eat some pasta, you know, 
    perfect day. And then if it’s warm enough, I’d probably go to swim 
    or something at the beach.
    
    As the sun begins to set, Medill sophomore Raghav Khosla would head 
    to Welsh Ryan Arena to catch the ‘Cats take on the Purdue Boilermakers.
    
    RAGHAV KHOSLA: I’m gonna get there an hour and a half early, making 
    sure I get seats by the Northwestern bench three or four rows up 
    from the court, and then listen to that wonderful Welsh Ryan pregame 
    mix, watching the guys warm up, booing Purdue and Zach Edey and Fletcher 
    Loyer and all the guys on Purdue that I’m not the biggest fan of.
    
    At eight o’clock, the game begins. 
    
[nat sound: tennis shoes squeaking on court, crowd chanting]
    
    KHOSLA: It’s game time, it’s a back and forth game, and just like it 
    happened this year, it’s gonna go to overtime and Northwestern is going 
    to win. We’re going to storm the court just to have a phenomenal time 
    beating number one Purdue. 
    
    Under the moonlight, SESP senior Jude Abijah would head into the city 
    for a night of music and fun. 
    
    JUDE ABIJAH: In the evening, I probably would want to get a light meal 
    and go to a concert. Doesn’t have to be like a huge concert. It can be, 
    but it could also be like a small, indie local band, maybe. And just feel 
    some music with some people—I feel like that’d be really fun. 
    
    After a long night out, Abijah would appease his appetite with a delicious 
    late night dinner.  
    
    ABIJAH: After that, I would like to get a huge meal. I remember one time 
    after a concert, I went to get tacos in Pilsen. And that was literally the 
    best experience of my life, so, if I could replicate that feeling, that 
    would be great. 
    
    For Bikales, the end of her day would be picturesque. 
    
[nat sound: waves crashing]
    
    BIKALES: I always find that stargazing on the beach is the best because it’s 
    the most clear as long as it’s a clear night out and in my ideal world. I mean, 
    an ideal day would be very clear so that you can see everything and then we’d 
    come back, get ready for bed and then go to bed around midnight and get a good 
    night’s rest. And yeah, that would be my perfect day.

  <h2>What’s the deal with Colleen Hoover?</h2>

  <pre>
    CASEY AONSO: Colleen Hoover, while definitely one of the most popular 
    authors right now, also has to be one of the most controversial.

    NIKKI CARREON: Colleen Hoover is one of the most popular authors in America. 
    
    CALEB JOSEPH: I’m not sure if you guys know this, but I’m not a very big fan 
    of Colleen Hoover. 
    
    While walking through bookstores or scrolling through TikTok, it’s hard to 
    ignore Colleen Hoover’s presence in literary spaces. You can often spot her 
    eye-catching covers on Target shelves or her name popping up on year-end lists 
    across BookTube, a subcommunity of YouTube dedicated to literature. 
    
    In 2022, her books outsold the Bible, according to Today, and at one point, 
    six of her novels simultaneously occupied the New York Times top-10 paperback 
    bestseller list. Named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people last 
    year, Hoover’s popularity has only been on the rise.
    
    With a movie based on her most popular novel “It Ends with Us” set to come out 
    this year, we decided to investigate all the commotion surrounding her books
    —both good and bad.
    
    MELISSA DAI: I’ve heard of quite a few, I think, but I’ve read three, and they 
    are “Verity,” “It Ends with Us,” and “It Starts with Us,” which is the sequel 
    to “It Ends with Us” that recently came out.
    
    That’s Medill sophomore Melissa Dai. Like many readers of Hoover’s novels, 
    Dai was initially influenced by social media to pick up the books.
    
    DAI: To see so many people raving about books and reviewing books and giving 
    book recommendations—that made me want to read much more—that’s what initially 
    got me into it, and Colleen Hoover’s a huge, huge presence on TikTok.
    
    Speaking specifically on “It Ends with Us,” one of Hoover’s most popular books, 
    Dai said the novel provided her the entertainment necessary to get her out of 
    a reading slump. 
    
    DAI: It was a good book, in my opinion, in terms of how dynamic the plot was, 
    character building, and all of that. I feel like the plot was somewhat 
    predictable, but also I think—I personally think it was well done.
    
    Others were more critical about Hoover’s literary stylings. For Weinberg 
    sophomore Yong-Yu Huang, poetry editor of Northwestern’s Helicon Literary 
    & Arts Magazine, Hoover’s treatment of character and plot in “It Ends with Us” 
    particularly bothered her. 
    
    YONG-YU HUANG: I think something that really irked me about her writing was 
    just—all her descriptions felt very predictable. And also, they were often 
    reused. So you would be reading kind of the same description of the same 
    character over and over again, throughout the novel, which didn’t really 
    add to your understanding of the character or further the plot in any way 
    that I could really see.
    
    Knox College junior Maisie Quinlan similarly had her own qualms about Hoover’s 
    writing and character choices in reviewing her bestselling title “Ugly Love”:
    
    MAISIE QUINLAN: I’ve told people that I’ve never regretted reading a book 
    until this one. I really wish that I just, like, out of sight out of mind. 
    It upset me, the characters upset me, the writing upset me. It was not my thing.
    
    One major criticism Hoover’s books have received is their potential 
    romanticization of abuse and toxic relationship dynamics, something 
    Quinlan cited as a reason for her personal wariness of them.
    
    QUINLAN: A lot of the relationships are like, very unintentionally, just 
    forms of abuse. I think she never really portrays healthy relationship 
    dynamics, and so I don’t even feel comfortable labeling most of her books 
    as romance, just because they’re not—this is misleading at best.
    
    College of DuPage Junior Ethan Burdin found himself irritated by the plot 
    of Hoover’s “It Ends with Us” from the very beginning, prompting him to 
    put down the book soon after starting it:
    
    ETHAN BURDIN: I started reading it about a month ago, and I read the first 
    chapter and I absolutely cannot read anymore. I don’t know, everything that 
    you don’t want a book to be—or at least I don’t want a book to be—got thrown 
    at me in the first chapter.
    
    Despite her popularity, Hoover’s writing has become a divisive topic across 
    social media platforms and online book communities alike, contributing 
    to the general air of confusion and intrigue surrounding her novels: 
    
    HUANG: The whole internet was talking about her and her books and reviews 
    were very polarizing. And I just wanted to see for myself.
    
    QUINLAN: I kept seeing like a bunch of hate videos for this book specifically, 
    but then also TikTokers that I follow were reading it and they liked it, and 
    I was like really confused.
    
    BURDIN: I have a friend who I was talking to yesterday, and she was like, 
    “Oh, I love Colleen Hoover books,” and I was like, “really?” I think people 
    deserve better, but I don’t know, I don’t know why people like them. 
    I really don’t.
    
    Because of her widespread presence throughout the internet, Hoover’s novels 
    tend to skew towards a younger audience. As to why much of Generation Z 
    has picked up a book or two, Huang said that Hoover’s writing widely appeals 
    to those who merely want to be entertained. 
    
    HUANG: Sometimes I just want a light read—something that I don’t really 
    have to think about. I can just enjoy the plot, enjoy characters, and have 
    something fun to do after a long day of work. And I think that the reason 
    that so many people are drawn to Colleen Hoover is because she provides—she 
    doesn’t make the reader have to think.
    
    With the movie adaptation of “It Ends with Us” set to release in June of 
    this year, fans of Hoover’s are already eager to buy their tickets. For Dai, 
    however, the Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively-starring film has yet to really 
    cross her mind. 
    
    DAI: I haven’t been following it. But it does sound interesting. And also, 
    I like Blake Lively. So let’s see.
